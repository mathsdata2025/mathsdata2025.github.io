### How to attend
Applications are now closed. All admitted applicants have been notified by email. Due to an exceptionally high number of applications—far exceeding the number of available spots—we had to make many difficult decisions during the selection process.

Please note: due to a technical issue in the application form, we were unable to collect email addresses from some applicants. We regret not being able to inform some non-admitted applicants directly. This did not affect the selection process, which was conducted independently of contact information.

To EPFL applicants: Due to the high number of applications from EPFL, we have decided not to enroll any EPFL-based participants in this edition of the summer school. The lectures will be live broadcasted on this [zoom link](https://epfl.zoom.us/j/68817774793?pwd=wqaR87mlQ86TOCaAwj3JYdjPEEQUwI.1)
